# Scenario format hardening: build log

Plan: `docs/achitechture/SCENARIO_FORMAT_HARDENING_PLAN.md` (Final). Branch `build/harden-step1`, made from main f2d53bb40 with the Final plan merged in (e94325cd3).

## Step 1. The validator's exit code matches its output

Date: 2026-11-12. Line numbers in the plan were taken on 33c003230; on f2d53bb40 `def main` sat at `scripts/validate_scenario.rb:6780`, the common stage at 6949-6970 in the plan is the same 22 calls, and the early exits were at 6833 (no file), 6855 (directory), 6903 (structure), 6939 (ink), 7090 (schema), 7152 (graph key), 7163 (strict social) and 7184 (rescue).

### What changed

- **One writer.** `scripts/validator_report.rb` (`ValidatorReport`) replaces `$stdout` while `main` runs, so every line, including those a module prints itself, goes through it. A line holding `❌` is an error tagged with the current stage (`ink`, `schema`, `common`, `habits`, `work`, `social`); a line that starts (after a list number) with `⚠️` is a warning; section headers go through `header` and are never counted. `finish` prints any stale-entry lines and `Result: <n> errors (<k> known), <m> warnings`, plus `; <j> known failure(s) not checked (<stage> skipped)`, and returns the exit code: 1 when an unlisted error remains.
- **One label.** `❌ INVALID:` became `❌ ERROR:` (114 sites in validate_scenario.rb on f2d53bb40, not the 108 the plan counted). `❌ SOCIAL:` became `❌ ERROR: SOCIAL:` in validate_social.rb and `validate_social/{mail,dm_app,pretext,options}.rb`.
- **Schema errors** print as `❌ ERROR: schema: <json pointer> (<room, object or NPC>): <message>` without the gem's `in schema <uuid>` tail (`format_schema_error`, `describe_schema_pointer`).
- **Every section prints.** Directory, structure, schema and ink-check failures no longer exit. Structure errors print in the schema stage and the run goes on, so a `rooms` string reaches the schema and the checks (which then print `could not run`). Only a failed ERB render stops the run (nothing to check), and it still prints `❌ ERROR: ERB render could not run` and the Result line.
- **Ink compile failure.** `check_ink_files` already skips the compiled-JSON checks for a file that fails to compile; the run now says so (`⏭️ <n> ink file(s) failed to compile ...`) and marks the ink stage as not run in full.
- **A rescue per check.** `ValidatorReport#run_check` wraps each of the 22 common calls (including `NpcHabits.expanded_copy`, `ValidateNpcNeeds`, `ValidateAccessWork`, `ValidateNpcHabits`), the directory, structure, unknown-field, wiring (objectives, scoring, result, ending check), geometry, door, ink, dialogue lint, schema, social, habits report, work report, recommended-field and desk-box calls. An exception prints `❌ ERROR: <check> could not run: <class>: <message>`, marks its stage as not run in full, and the next call runs. Before, the three mission.json wiring checks shared one silent `rescue`; each now reports.
- **Social.** Social lint and `#/social` schema lines print in the social stage and fail the run like any `❌`. `--strict-social` stays accepted (CI passes it) and only prints the old count line, which four tests read.
- **Known failures.** `--known-failures <file>` (default `scripts/validator_known_failures.json`) and `--no-known-failures`. Matching is per scenario (repo-relative path, or the absolute path a test passes), per stage, by substring, up to `count` lines; `could not run`, `stale known failure` and `Result:` lines are never matched, and a `match` that is part of `❌ ERROR: ` is ignored. A broken list file prints `❌ ERROR: known-failures list could not run`.
- **AGENTS.md** gains the plan's line in its "Verifying work" validator bullet. `docs/agents/VALIDATOR_DECISIONS.md` is new.
- **README.** `README_scenario_design.md`: a new "The exit code is the answer" section under "Running the Validator" (labels, every section prints, could-not-run, the Result line, social schema errors fatal on every run, the known-failures list), the `--strict-social` section reworded, and two `❌ INVALID` mentions renamed. `README_ink_best_practices.md`: one label renamed.

### False positives and this build's fixtures

- sis01_healthcare (1): `check_interaction_warnings` no longer walks into `minigameData`.
- sis02_energy (3): `nextTabPrompt`, `nextTabButton`, `completeBanner` added to `log_filter_terminal`'s optional list in `scripts/minigame-data-schemas.json`.
- keyPins (33 lines in 6 test scenarios): every key lock and its key got the same `keyPins` array. The keys in test_complex_multidirection, test_multiple_connections, test_mixed_room_sizes, test_vertical_layout and test_horizontal_layout had no `opens_lock` at all, so none of them opened its door; each now has the `opens_lock` its name implies (Office 1 Key opens `office1_key`, and so on). test_behind_wall_fade's wall key opens nothing and only got `keyPins`.
- test-rfid-multiprotocol (2): guards moved from `hacker-green`/`hacker-yellow` to `hacker`/`hacker-red`.
- npc-sprite-test2 (2): the helper NPC now holds a spare phone and keycard for the shared `helper-npc.ink` `#give_item` tags. The shared ink is unchanged.
- test_desk_seating (1 schema): `room_test_desk_seating` added to the room `type` enum (the map exists).
- test-blockchain-explorer (2 schema): no code reads a `set_global` task type or `targetGlobal`, so the two tasks are now `custom` (they never completed before either; completing them from the explorer's flag globals is new work, not done here).
- test_table_items (4 schema): the four tables got names.
- test-ble-scanner (2 schema, 1 hidden common): `ble` is a real lock type (client `unlock-system.js` `case 'ble'`, server `game.rb` lock-type table and unlock paths) missing from both `lockType` enums; added. Its `ble_scanner` start item had no sprite: `public/break_escape/assets/objects/ble_scanner.png` is a byte copy of `bluetooth_scanner.png` (the icon the BLE minigame already shows).
- sf_clean (test fixture): its mail NPC lacked `phoneId`, a common `❌` that used to pass under `--strict-social` because only social errors counted.

The plan's section 3.2 named "top-level name, description and others" for test-ble-scanner and "globalItems and others" for basic_mission and vm_free_mission. The step 1 run shows other lines: test-ble-scanner's were the `ble` lock type and the sprite; basic_mission and vm_free_mission each print 4 schema lines (no `scenario_brief`, `flags` as an array, start room without `type` and `connections`). `globalItems` is an unknown-field warning, not a schema error.

### Corpus triage

All 177 `scenarios/*/scenario.json.erb`, `LANG=C.UTF-8 /usr/bin/ruby3.2 scripts/validate_scenario.rb <f> --no-graph` (ink on, lint on), the merge-batch flags. "Before" is the old validator on f2d53bb40; "raw" is the new validator with `--no-known-failures` before the fixture fixes (sis01 and sis02 were already fixed); "after" is the branch with the list.

| | lines with ❌ | scenarios with ❌ | exit 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| before (old validator) | 103 | 21 | 14 |
| raw (new validator, no list, sis fixes in) | 128 | 25 | 25 |
| after (fixes and list) | 81, all known | 13 | 0 |

Leaving out the 4 sis lines fixed first, the new validator shows 29 lines the old one did not: ceo_exfil's 10 `targetKnot` lines and lab_malware_metasploit's task line (behind the ink exit), and 18 from the 6 schema failures, whose schema lines now carry `❌` (basic_mission 4, vm_free_mission 4, test_table_items 4, test-blockchain-explorer 2, test_desk_seating 1) plus test-ble-scanner's 2 schema lines and its sprite line, which was behind the schema exit. No check raised on any corpus scenario: there is no `could not run` line in the corpus. m01 to m10 print 0 `❌` and exit 0. No scenario that exited 0 with no `❌` before changed.

By owner, 132 lines in all (128 raw plus the 4 sis false positives fixed first):

- this build: 51 (4 false positives, 33 keyPins, 2 sprites, 2 helper items, 10 in the four schema fixtures), all fixed;
- labs track: 49 lines in 8 entries (48 `ink`, 1 `common`; the plan said 47 ink, the run says 48: 13 + 12 + 7 + 2 + 10 + 3 + 1);
- escape-room track: 24 lines in 6 entries (`git log -1` on each template and ink folder: last change 2026-10-22 or earlier, so the track has not restarted);
- the user, q86: basic_mission 4 and vm_free_mission 4, one entry each.

### Known-failures entries (awaiting sign-off)

16 entries, 81 lines, `added` 2026-11-12, proposed `reviewBy` 2026-12-10. Each has a heading in `docs/agents/VALIDATOR_DECISIONS.md` marked "awaiting orchestrator sign-off".

With `--skip-ink`, the 7 ink entries are "not checked" and never fail a run.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, "Validator over scenarios with a social key": replayed locally over the 84 scenarios its lister finds, `--strict-social --no-graph --skip-ink`: all exit 0. The "no tracked file was rewritten" step is unaffected (`--no-graph`, and `git status` was clean after every corpus run). The merge-batch rule becomes "the validator exits 0" (0 unlisted `❌`).

### Test audit

The plan's known cases, all updated in the same branch:

- old labels: `validator-pin-locks` (2), `validator-mission-result` (3), `validator-mission-scoring` (1), `validator-combination-cryptex` (3), `validator-action-condition` (6), `validator-social-followups` (3), `validator-social-schema` (4), `validator-social-triage` (1), `validator-social-awareness` (1);
- exit 0 on output holding `❌`: `validator-social-schema` (the `checklistTimeing` plain run), `validator-social-framework` (sf_broken plain, sf_nosocial, sf_sprite plain), `validator-social-pretext` (sp_broken plain), `validator-social-mail` (sm_broken plain); each now expects 1;
- `validator-conclusion-screen` matched the gem's raw schema text (`conclusionScreen/type' value`); it now matches the new form;
- `validator-social-framework` sf_clean under `--strict-social`: the fixture's own `phoneId` error, fixed in the fixture.

`❌ ERROR` matches in `dungeon-graph-networks`, `npc-left-behind`, `npc-needs-slots` and `validator-office-presets` were already on the new label. No Rails test reads the validator, the schema or the edited scenarios.

### Tests

- New: `test/js/validator-exit-code.test.mjs` (21), `test/js/validator-known-failures.test.mjs` (10, real list plus the checker), shared reader `test/js/validator-decisions-reader.mjs`.
- Run without the lock under `RBENV_VERSION=2.7.8`: every test file that runs the validator or reads the schema, the minigame schemas or sf_clean, plus `table-item-overlap-grouping`: 70 files, 70 PASS. `MERGE_BATCH=1 node test/js/validator-known-failures.test.mjs`: pass.
- Not run: the full suites (the orchestrator runs them under the lock at the merge batch).

### Proposed wording (not edited: skills and the common brief are outside this branch)

- **Common brief**, replacing "Count every line with ❌ as a failure: the validator labels some INVALID rather than ERROR": "The validator's exit code is the answer: 0 means no unlisted `❌`. A listed line prints with `(known: <owner>, since <date>)`."
- **validate-scenario** line 24: "**Errors (must fix)**: every `❌ ERROR:` line, each on its own line with the path bolded. The exit code is the answer (1 while any unlisted `❌` remains); a line marked `(known: <owner>, since <date>)` is on `scripts/validator_known_failures.json` and belongs to that owner. Quote the `Result:` line."
- **scenario-design-review** line 22: "| ❌ ERROR | Must fix before the scenario will work; the validator exits 1 while any unlisted one remains | List all, bold the path; name the owner of a `(known: ...)` line |"; line 50: "(the validator reports this as ❌ ERROR)"; line 203: "All unlisted ❌ ERROR lines from the validator, and the known ones with their owner".
- **walkthrough-scenario** line 29: "Any ❌ ERROR or ⚠️ WARNING lines (the validator exits 1 on an unlisted ❌); note them briefly ...".
- **npc-dialog-review** line 32: "❌ ERROR for a name used 5+ times in a file ...".
- **break-escape-dungeon-graph** line 25: "Report the validator's exit code and its `Result:` line; list any `❌ ERROR` lines (a `(known: ...)` one with its owner) and `⚠️` warnings."
- **mission-puzzle-chains**: its `❌` marks are its own table markers, not validator labels; no change.

### Open

- Sign-off of the 16 entries and their `reviewBy` dates (orchestrator, with the labs and escape-room owners and the user for q86).
- The `acknowledgedClues` and payload-exception lists do not exist yet; the list test reads the exceptions file once 6a-1 adds it, and step 3 adds the markers to the shared-heading check.
- test-blockchain-explorer's two tasks are `custom` and still never complete in play.
- build/phone-calls and build/phone-calls-writing (plan section 5): whoever merges second redoes the label rename on their validator lines.
