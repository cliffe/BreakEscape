  <name>Symmetric Encryption with AES</name>
  <author>Z. Cliffe Schreuders</author>
  <description>
    You’ve stumbled upon the secret workshop of the brilliant but eccentric scientist, Dr. Knowitall, who has built a revolutionary time machine. However, the blueprints for the machine are hidden behind a series of cryptographic puzzles, protected by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Dr. Knowitall’s workshop is rigged with a self-destruct mechanism, and you must solve the puzzles quickly to retrieve the blueprints before time runs out.

    In this escape room, you will explore the principles of symmetric encryption, focusing on AES, a widely used block cipher that secures data through cyberchef.

    But beware: time is relative, and so is your escape. The self-destruct countdown is ticking, and every second counts. Can you outsmart Dr. Knowitall’s puzzles, master AES encryption, and escape with the blueprints before it’s too late?
